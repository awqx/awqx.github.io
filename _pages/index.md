Last updated: 2025-03-10. 

I am a postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) researcher at the Machine Learning Core at the National Institute of Mental Health, directed by Dr. Francisco Pereira. I work on experimental machine learning applications in psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience and statistical research on functional mixed models. 

This fall, I will be entering the Statistics + Program in Neural Computation PhD program at Carnegie Mellon University.

I also work part-time as a contractor for the Harvard Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics (CCDD), where I help with CCDD branding and site maintenance. 

## Why does the name look like that? 

I sometimes stylize my name as aL to avoid sans serif ambiguities with "AI". This has been a recurring problem for an aL interested in artificial intelligence. 

## Why does the site look like that?

Currently reorganizing things. I used to host my CV on Substack, for example, but I am mmoving my blog/newsletter attempts to Buttondown. I am also planning to change my GitHub domain name (with delays due to providing this URL to PhD applications).

The site is mashed together from the Jekyll theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io) and its fork [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/), which may cause strange inconsistencies and layout failures. I use the font [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible) for readability.

## Background

I graduated from Harvard in 2023 (Statistics major and Linguistics minor). I wrote a senior thesis with the Murray lab at Harvard Medical School on a genome-wide association study of *M. tuberculosis*. At Harvard, I was Program Director for Harvard Effective Altruism (HEA), President of Harvard Breakers, and Design Chair on the Adams House Committee. 

I previously worked as a teaching fellow (Harvard's term for a teaching assistant) for CS 50, STAT 110, STAT 111, and STAT 210. I do some commissioned graphic design work, such as logo design, including the course logo for STAT 210.

I have an (optionally) anonymous feedback form [here](https://www.admonymous.co/al), which will reach me through email.

You can find me at Bluesky @[alxin.me](https://bsky.app/profile/alxin.me). I own the URL alxove.com for blogging, but I am currently working on migrating from Substack to Buttondown.
